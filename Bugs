Bugs:
- App crashes if defaultdir path is "/"
- can't copy/move to directory which root
- files and folders in /data or other directory's witch need root are not correctly shown
- Search does not work at all
- If you choose "Move" and immediately inserted into the same folder, the file is simply
  deleted without warning that the file already exists. In this case, 
  a message that is copied successfully, but it is not true
